### Computer Vision Algorithm for the Object Detection of Polygons


Here a folder that stores the data and hopefully does automatic training/testing of the model performance for the lunar zebro "traici" 2024 conference will be created.

The objectives of the repository: 

- 1. Have files to allow training and testing of the model
- 2. Have an easy way to download/access the data
- 3. Create Github Actions in order to automatically train/test the model based on the desired configurations
- 4. Create Combine with google bucket so that github actions performs training automatically with key



## How to use the repository 

If you want to train a model locally, please download this repository and the click the following link to download the data:\
